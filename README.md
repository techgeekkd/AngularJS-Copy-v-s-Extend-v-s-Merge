AngularJS : Copy v/s Extend v/s Merge - Interview Ready in 8 Minutes

There are a lot of articles on the said subject, so why one more ?

Most articles which are present over the internet either provide the theoretical details or some code snippets. I believe that reading code snippets will Never clear the subject, and people are often boring to create a project and make them run. I personally feel that live coding brief is the best way to understand and memorize a concept. 

I have created a small code setup which you can run from the page itself and the 8 Minute Video guides you through the concepts which I try to explain line by line in the code.
